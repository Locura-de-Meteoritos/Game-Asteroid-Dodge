## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 Highlights

This initial release brings together real NASA data with cutting-edge web technology to create an educational and entertaining space survival game. Players can experience what it's like to navigate through real asteroid fields while learning about Near-Earth Objects that actually exist in space.

The game features a sophisticated information system that provides real-time data about asteroids, including their official NASA designations, sizes, velocities, and hazard classifications. This makes it both a game and an educational tool for space enthusiasts.

### Technical Achievements

- Successfully integrated NASA's NeoWs API for real-time asteroid data
- Implemented efficient 3D rendering with Three.js for smooth gameplay
- Created a responsive notification system that handles multiple asteroid alerts
- Developed a persistent information panel for continuous situational awareness
- Built a complete game loop with proper state management and cleanup

### Educational Value

The game serves as an interactive way to learn about:
- Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) and their classifications
- Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)
- Real asteroid sizes, velocities, and orbital data
- Space navigation challenges
- NASA's planetary defense efforts
